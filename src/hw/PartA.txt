NOTE on COMPLETENESS OF THIS ASSIGNMENT:

This information was also included in my email turning the assignment in.
I did not complete SkipList in time. As such, the files SetofStrings.java, SkipListofStrings.java,
and SkipNode.java are all very incomplete and should be ignored for the most part.
I am going to try and finish skip-lists and turn it in late tomorrow,
I will send and email and update this note when I do.
Thanks

Excercise a)
f0(1) = 1. f0(n) = n + f0(n/2).
2n -1
examples:
n = 16 ->
16 + f(8)
24 + f(4)
28 + f(2)
30 + f(1)
31

f1(1) = 1. f1(n) = n + f1(n-1).
average of (n + n -1 + n -2 ... n(0)) = 1/2n
times n's added for n iterations + 1 for f(0)
1/2n(n+1)
f2(1) = 1. f2(n) = c + f2(n-1), for some constant c.
N counts down adding c each time (n times total), plus f(1) which = 1
cn + 1
f3(1) = 1. f3(n) = c + f3(n/2), for some constant c.
for each doubling of n, c increases by 1, + f(0) which = 1 -
->c log (base 2) n + 1
f4(1) = 1. f4(n) = n + 2*f4(n/2)
n/2 + nlog(b2) (n)
f5(1) = 1. f5(n) = c + 2*f5(n/2), for some constant c.
c(n-½)
f6(1) = 1. f6(n) = c + 2*f6(n-1), for some constant c.
I was unable to solve this recurrence relation correctly.​
